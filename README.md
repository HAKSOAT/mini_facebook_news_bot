This is a Facebook chat bot script.

You would require a developer token and a page token from facebook.

Also you would need to generate a procfile if deploying on heroku.

xyz in the uploaded procfile should be the name of the created app.

View the requirements.txt file to see the requirements. 

I intended using a database, but I'm getting stuck.

Any action to come up with a database code will be appreciated.

I'm new to open source.

Thank you.
